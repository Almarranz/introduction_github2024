# Description

This session is a hands-on introduction to using GitHub for scientific research collaboration within the  Severo Ochoa Training Initiative of the IAA-CSIC. We’ll explore software repositories and their role in managing and sharing research work within a group. Key concepts—such as commits, forks, pushes, pulls, and pull requests—will be clarified with practical examples of their use. Participants will also receive practical guidance on repository management and effective collaboration techniques. The session includes a hands-on component where attendees will create repositories and work together to build and populate a shared repository using GitHub’s tools.

The main page of the event is in Indico [Introduction to Github](https://indico.iaa.csic.es/e/github2024 ). This repository is only for the material.
