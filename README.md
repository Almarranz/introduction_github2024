# Description

This session is a hands-on introduction to using GitHub for scientific research collaboration within the  Severo Ochoa Training Initiative of the IAA-CSIC. Weâ€™ll explore software repositories and their role in managing and sharing research work within a group. Key conceptsâ€”such as commits, forks, pushes, pulls, and pull requestsâ€”will be clarified with practical examples of their use. Participants will also receive practical guidance on repository management and effective collaboration techniques. The session includes a hands-on component where attendees will create repositories and work together to build and populate a shared repository using GitHubâ€™s tools.

The main page of the event is in Indico [Introduction to Github](https://indico.iaa.csic.es/e/github2024). This repository is only for the material.
